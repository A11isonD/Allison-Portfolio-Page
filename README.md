# Allison-Portfolio-Page
This is my portfolio page that features my skills, projects, and experience.  The intended audience is potential employers.  I included two media queries.  My project contains three CSS and JavaScript features from the required list:  
    1. A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes.  
    2. *Flexbox or CSS Grid (one or maybe both)* to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views.
    3. JavaScript 'Contact Me' form   

There are no special instructions required to run this project.
